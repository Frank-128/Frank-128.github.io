        Centennial Christian Seminary (CCS) can trace its history back to the establishment of the Tanzania Presbyterian Church(TPC).
        TPC was established in 1994 by missionaries Rev. Deuk-Yeon Hwang and his wife Mrs. Yohannes Hwang from South Korea. Today TPC has grown into a large Christian institution with many branches all over the country.
        It focuses on three ministries; church mininstry, health ministry and education mininstry. it was here, under the education branch that Philadelphia Pre and Primary School(PPS) and CCS were able to emerge.

        In the year 2001, TPC established a nursery school to preach the world of God to children and to teach a higher level of education. It soon expanded and in 2002 the school began its primary school,PPS.
        By God's grace in 2011 CCS was formed and was able to start admitting students. Under the banner of TPC, CCS has been able to expand and flourish over the years at Kongowe-Mbagala in Dar-es Salaam, Tanzania
